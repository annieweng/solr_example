		 "text" : "7522613901.txt Millions of liberal fools demanding you reduce the Internet to a public utility don?t give that idea any actual merit.  Many of these organizations are openly socialist and see destroying a major sector of the U.S. economy as a good thing in itself.  Others are simply being swept up in sloganeering from comedians.  And the same scare stories have been told for ten years ? that unless you regulate, big bad phone and cable companies will destroy the Internet.  Never happened and never will,because of competition.  But a powerful government regulator really could create mischief, and there would be no place else to turn.  Don?t ruin a good thing.Page 1",

		 "text" : "7522613903.txt Regulating the Internet would be a job killer.  All those who are employed as tech support, companies that make and deploy servers, routers, coax and fiber-optic cablewill suffer job losses if the FCC chases billions of dollars of investments away by regulating Internet services as if they were a public utility.  Every time Washington bureaucrats have grabbed massive new powers for themselves, they have created economic and human wreckage in their wake.  Obamacare regulations on the healthcare system have cost millions of Americans their health insurance, and raisedthe cost of insurance and deductibles to millions more.  Dodd-Frank financial regulations have shuttered smaller banks and dried up loans to small businesses thatcreate jobs.  And the EPA?s draconian rules have driven up electricity prices for millions of Americans.  Now the FCC is considering massive new regulations on the Internet, and this power grab threatens to cost the American people dearly as well.Page 1",

We are a country built on principles of free people and free markets, and nothing epitomizes that like the Internet.  The Internet is already free and open, for the simple reason that competition between providers forces it tobe free and open.  That?s what customers want.   There is no need for the governmentto intervene to create something that already exists.  The unregulated Internet already helps promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and freedom of speech. Let the free economy do what it does best, and stop trying to regulate the Internet!.Page 1",

The FCC could improve broadband delivery by auctioning off much-needed spectrum.  Or it could get rid of some of its own burdensome rules that prevent companies from attracting investors and innovating.  But instead of doing these things that would improve the Internet, the FCC is wasting its time in an obsessive drive to regulate. This tells the American people that once again, a Washington agency is working in aself-interested way to increase its own power at the expense of the free people it is meant to serve.Page 1",

When a government agency like the FCC follows such extremists, acting without evidence, and increasing its own power under imaginary orfalse pretenses, then the people?s representatives in Congress must cut off its funding and place its necessary duties in the hands of agencies that will act responsibly.  All legislative powers reside in the Congress of the United States.  The FCC knows full well that the 1996 Communications Act was a deregulatory bill.  But in its zeal to ignore the letter and spirit of that law, and place severe regulations on the Internet, the FCC is usurping the legislative powers of the Congress by attempting to rewrite the laws passed by Congress.  Such shocking disregard of the will of Congress will not stand.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522613882.txt Of the million or so comments the Federal Communications Commission received on its rulemaking, did any make an evidence-based case that the Internet is not free, open,and functioning well?  Evidence matters.  And there simply is no evidence to back upthe dire claims of disaster if the Internet is left unregulated.  The unregulated Internet is probably the greatest success story of the century.  The body of evidence is very clear ? investment and innovation aimed at winning customers is themost powerful force for good when it comes to developing the Internet.  Tens of billions of private dollars pour into its networks every year, even in a bad economy.  The only reason to change this is to appease a small left-wing political faction that is ideologically obsessed with government control over the economy.  Ifthe FCC has descended to the depths where it ignores evidence so it can appease an ignorant, angry left-wing political faction, then it is time to consider whether theagency should continue to exist in its present form.Page 1",

When a government agency like the FCC follows such extremists, acting without evidence, and increasing its own power under imaginary orfalse pretenses, then the people?s representatives in Congress must cut off its funding and place its necessary duties in the hands of agencies that will act responsibly.  All legislative powers reside in the Congress of the United States.  The FCC knows full well that the 1996 Communications Act was a deregulatory bill.  But in its zeal to ignore the letter and spirit of that law, and place severe regulations on the Internet, the FCC is usurping the legislative powers of the Congress by attempting to rewrite the laws passed by Congress.  Such shocking disregard of the will of Congress will not stand.Page 1",

In an interview with SocialistProject.ca, McChesney said: ?What we want to have in the U.S. and in every society is an Internet that is not private property, but a public utility...At the moment, the battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies. We are not at thatpoint yet. But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phoneand cable companies and to divest them from control.? In a country of over 300 million people, even an extremist like McChesney can find, perhaps, millions of followers.  But you should know better than to listen to them.Page 1",

All those who are employed as tech support, companies that make and deploy servers, routers, coax and fiber-optic cablewill suffer job losses if the FCC chases billions of dollars of investments away by regulating Internet services as if they were a public utility.  Every time Washington bureaucrats have grabbed massive new powers for themselves, they have created economic and human wreckage in their wake.  Obamacare regulations on the healthcare system have cost millions of Americans their health insurance, and raisedthe cost of insurance and deductibles to millions more.  Dodd-Frank financial regulations have shuttered smaller banks and dried up loans to small businesses thatcreate jobs.  And the EPA?s draconian rules have driven up electricity prices for millions of Americans.  Now the FCC is considering massive new regulations on the Internet, and this power grab threatens to cost the American people dearly as well.Page 1",

The Internet does not need the federal government?s ?help,? and neither the American people nor their elected representatives are asking for the federal government to place political controls over the Internet.  The people calling for government control over the Internet are a tiny minority of far-left political activists, and the FCC knows it.  Any effort by the FCC to regulate the Internet will be seen by the vast majority of the American people for what it is -- another lawless Obama Administration power grab.Page 1",

Obamacare regulations on the healthcare system have cost millions of Americans their health insurance, and raisedthe cost of insurance and deductibles to millions more.  Dodd-Frank financial regulations have shuttered smaller banks and dried up loans to small businesses thatcreate jobs.

	 "text" : "7522613973.txt Of the million or so comments the Federal Communications Commission received on its rulemaking, did any make an evidence-based case that the Internet is not free, open,and functioning well?  Evidence matters.  And there simply is no evidence to back upthe dire claims of disaster if the Internet is left unregulated.  The unregulated Internet is probably the greatest success story of the century.  The body of evidence is very clear ? investment and innovation aimed at winning customers is themost powerful force for good when it comes to developing the Internet.  Tens of billions of private dollars pour into its networks every year, even in a bad economy.  The only reason to change this is to appease a small left-wing political faction that is ideologically obsessed with government control over the economy.  Ifthe FCC has descended to the depths where it ignores evidence so it can appease an ignorant, angry left-wing political faction, then it is time to consider whether theagency should continue to exist in its present form.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522613977.txt A small fringe of the extremist left has been demanding a government takeover of theInternet for over ten years, but cannot point to any actual misbehavior that would justify such a takeover.  When a government agency like the FCC follows such extremists, acting without evidence, and increasing its own power under imaginary orfalse pretenses, then the people?s representatives in Congress must cut off its funding and place its necessary duties in the hands of agencies that will act responsibly.  All legislative powers reside in the Congress of the United States.  The FCC knows full well that the 1996 Communications Act was a deregulatory bill.  But in its zeal to ignore the letter and spirit of that law, and place severe regulations on the Internet, the FCC is usurping the legislative powers of the Congress by attempting to rewrite the laws passed by Congress.  Such shocking disregard of the will of Congress will not stand.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522613961.txt Before our government can handcuff a citizen, it must have some reasonable evidence that they have done something wrong.  Before the FCC places regulatory handcuffs on Internet providers, shouldn?t the government present evidence that they have actually done something wrong?  If the police were to handcuff someone because they might, theoretically, maybe, kind of do something wrong someday, there would be justifiable outrage.  Such is the case with the FCC?s attempt to place regulatory handcuffs on Internet providers ? just in case they might do something wrong someday.  The FCC?s rulemaking in the absence of any actual problem, any actual misbehavior on the part of Internet providers, or any consumer harm is beneath the dignity of an expert agency.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522613964.txt A small fringe of the extremist left has been demanding a government takeover of theInternet for over ten years, but cannot point to any actual misbehavior that would justify such a takeover.  When a government agency like the FCC follows such extremists, acting without evidence, and increasing its own power under imaginary orfalse pretenses, then the people?s representatives in Congress must cut off its funding and place its necessary duties in the hands of agencies that will act responsibly.  All legislative powers reside in the Congress of the United States.  The FCC knows full well that the 1996 Communications Act was a deregulatory bill.  But in its zeal to ignore the letter and spirit of that law, and place severe regulations on the Internet, the FCC is usurping the legislative powers of the Congress by attempting to rewrite the laws passed by Congress.  Such shocking disregard of the will of Congress will not stand.Page 1",

The FCC itself argued before the US Supreme Court that Internet services are unregulated information services, not a regulated telephone service.  And what events, or what new evidence does the FCC have to justify this about-face?  None whatsoever.  The FCC?s sudden change of mind in the absence of any real evidence or any clear problem is an arbitrary power grab,plain and simple to any reasonable person.  By taking such reckless actions to gain control over the Internet, the FCC is ironically presenting a powerful argument thatit has become largely irrelevant in the present world of competitive data services. As Congress reconsiders telecommunications in the coming years, it will no doubt consider what to do with the very expensive, largely irrelevant, and power-hungry agency that the FCC has sadly become.Page 1",

In regulating the Internet, the FCC is clearly ignoring the will of the American people, the will of the Congress, and the judgment of the Courts.  The dangerous legal waters this Administrations and the FCC are entering will end in a justifiable political backlash against those who overstepped their authority in an attempt to wield the powers of the federal government against those who they were sworn to serve.  If the FCC places these extreme federal regulations on the Internetin the face of Congressional and judicial opposition, it will harm the Internet and devastate its own reputation.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522613982.txt Millions of liberal fools demanding you reduce the Internet to a public utility don?t give that idea any actual merit.  Many of these organizations are openly socialist and see destroying a major sector of the U.S. economy as a good thing in itself.  Others are simply being swept up in sloganeering from comedians.  And the same scare stories have been told for ten years ? that unless you regulate, big bad phone and cable companies will destroy the Internet.  Never happened and never will,because of competition.  But a powerful government regulator really could create mischief, and there would be no place else to turn.  Don?t ruin a good thing.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522613986.txt Regulating the Internet would be a job killer.  All those who are employed as tech support, companies that make and deploy servers, routers, coax and fiber-optic cablewill suffer job losses if the FCC chases billions of dollars of investments away by regulating Internet services as if they were a public utility.  Every time Washington bureaucrats have grabbed massive new powers for themselves, they have created economic and human wreckage in their wake.  Obamacare regulations on the healthcare system have cost millions of Americans their health insurance, and raisedthe cost of insurance and deductibles to millions more.  Dodd-Frank financial regulations have shuttered smaller banks and dried up loans to small businesses thatcreate jobs.  And the EPA?s draconian rules have driven up electricity prices for millions of Americans.  Now the FCC is considering massive new regulations on the Internet, and this power grab threatens to cost the American people dearly as well.Page 1",

D. Can cities and municipalities create Wi-Fi networks?.........................................   I. ORIGIN OF RADIO REGULATION The origin of radio communication arose free and independent of government regulation in the United States. All persons had freedom to access the airwaves as government supervision was seen as a confluence of power and an assault on free speech.   With the proliferation of radio, interference began to plague the airwaves. Two parties could not broadcast on the same frequency at the same time and location without causing interference making it impossible to communicate.   II. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Subsequently, Congress realized that guidelines were necessary for the prevention of interference and legislated spectrum and future technology with broad language and “the source of all federal law, the constitution” of the United States (1).  Wherefrom the airwaves are bound by Federal jurisdiction and all laws both ambiguous and specific in language must withstand abridging freedom of speech and balance “public convenience, interest, or necessity” (2).  In so doing, the FRC guaranteed the right to free speech when legislating the airwaves as “public convenience, interest, or necessity requires”. The Radio Act of 1927, Section 29 reads: Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the licensing authority the               power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio             station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the licensing              authority which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio              communications.   Section 9 amended by Section 5 in March 1928 provides equality for people of all zones in spectrum allocation, frequency, and station power with the following:  'It is hereby declared that the people of all the zones established by section 82 (2) of this                  chapter are entitled to equality of radio broadcasting service, both of transmission and of              reception, and in order to provide said equality the licensing authority shall as nearly as               possible make and maintain an equal allocation of broadcasting licenses, of bands of             frequency or wave lengths, of periods of time for operation, and of station power, to each of                 said zones when and in so far as there are applications therefor; and shall make a fair and                  equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, time for operation, and station power to each              of the States, the District of Columbia, the Territories and possessions of the United States within                each zone, according to population' [emphasis added) (3).  With the inclusion of “public convenience, interest, or necessity”  and “fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, ... and station power” Government regulation was tolerated, and the FRC arrived at a series of comparative standards it thought fair and elastic from which it would issue applicants exclusive right to frequency for best serving the public interest (4).  ‘Since the number of channels is limited and the number of persons desiring to broadcast is                far greater than can be accommodated, the commission must determine from among the applicants              before it which of them will, if licensed, best serve the public’ (5).  III. Free Speech Inequality But by implementing the public interest standard, the Commission would breach the licensee's right to free speech whereby any authority derived in part from Government is in some respect an exercise by Government itself, and the Courts would maintain that ‘the fulfillment of the public interest requires the free exercise of’ the licensee’s ‘judgement’ and discharged the Commission’s responsibility to license by public interest (6).  Herein lies the great inequality whereby the broad provisions originating with radio - the \"right of free speech\" and \"fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, ... and station power\" have been repealed and we are left with laws that arbitrarly and contrary to “public convenience, interest, or necessity” forego a monopoly of spectrum that privilege the rights of licensed users over the great majority.  It is understood and agreed that regardless the vehicle [pipe, wire, radio, cable, satellite, or optic] communication by bandwidth is governed with laws imposed by Congress. It is also understood that Congress shall not make a law breaching the right to free speech.   While Government authority is tolerated by licensed regulation that emphasize First Amendment rights to licensed users, it’s authority is conversely absent when exercising First Amendment rights for the great majority by making and maintaining fair, efficient, and equitable allocation of licenses, frequency, and station power.  As Justice Douglas concluded in Superior Films v Department of Education “the First Amendment draws no distinction between the various methods of communicating ideas”.   While the right to use the airwaves is conditioned upon Federal regulation \"fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, ... and station power\" is paramount in accommodating free speech for the great majority. In this capacity free speech is significantly constrained for the great majority when a licensee's right is privileged by monopoly, station power, or superior frequency.   IV. INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, FREE SPEECH, AND PUBLIC CONVENIENCE, INTEREST, OR NECESSITY Similarly free speech and public interest, convenience, or necessity is breached when ISPs discriminate or prioritize internet access.   Insofar as broadband serves “an instrument for communication” and as \"an instrument for ... purveying commodities\" - ISPs “have to accept and transmit for all persons on an equal basis without discrimination” (7).   Respectively, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) on the last mile Internet connection must provide access to networks owned and operated by others “on an equal basis without discrimination” as public interest, convenience, or necessity requires.   Mark Taylor explains that fair and equitable access to the Internet should be evidenced by mandating networks to log and publish interconnection data ‘on a city-by-city basis, [with] a view into the level of use (and the congestion, if it is happening) or interconnections to the rest of the Internet. That level of transparency would provide subscribers with useful information on how robustly their ISP is connected to all content and applications available on the Internet’ (8).  Likewise, ISP’s should transport packets neutrally and without prioritization to eliminate preferential treatment and should not “discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer's broadband” connection (9).  If commercially reasonable practices or paid prioritization “are extended to some it gives them an unfair advantage over others”. If commercially reasonable practices or paid prioritization is considered, “what is the test or standard established by Congress, by which” prioritization “is to be controlled” from breaching “public convenience, interest, or necessity” or the right to free speech (10)?  If current regulation allows preferential treatment or discrimination, then present legislation is inadequate and any ambiguity should not be solved to embrace operations that breach free speech by inhibiting access to the public airwaves by the great majority and are not convenient to public interest. “Where there is ... specific provision relating to a particular subject, that provision must govern” (11).  V. Conclusion It is now well established that Federal jurisdiction over communication by bandwidth implicates First Amendment rights and requires public interest, convenience, or necessity. “And no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the licensing authority which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communications (2).” Wherefrom the commission’s regulatory responsibility involves making and maintaining fair, efficient, and equitable allocation of licenses, frequency, and station power and mandating that ISPs on the last mile provide fair, efficient, and equitable access to networks owned and operated by others without discrimination.   As The Commission on Freedom of the Press wrote in 1947, \"Civilized society is a working                system of ideas. It lives and changes by the consumption of ideas. Therefore, it must make sure                 that as many as possible of the ideas which its members have are available for its examination.\"  VI. Net Neutrality Questions: To Best protect and promote the open Internet, the FCC should ban any and all prioritization between Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) and content providers on the last mile Internet connection and mandate networks to log and publish interconnection data, agreements, and fees. The FCC should also remove restrictions that prevent cities and municipalities from creating Wi-Fi networks and broadband service. If the FCC cannot find authority to the aforementioned, it should seek a public Redress and adopt a statement of policy addressing the following:  - Does fair and equitable allocation of license, frequency, and station power benefit free speech for the vast majority or public convenience, interest, or necessity? - Is Spectrum a public utility? - Would a common carriage policy for broadband benefit the right to free speech for the great majority by airwave? - Would  public convenience, interest, or necessity benefit from a common carriage policy for broadband? - When a licensee's right is privileged by monopoly, station power, or superior frequency does it disenfranchise free speech by the great majority?  - When a licensee's right is privileged by monopoly, station power, or superior frequency does it disenfranchise public convenience, interest, or necessity? - If “the right to the use of the airwaves is conditioned upon ... license“ because of “the characteristics peculiar to” telecommunication, is government abandoning licensing whenever those peculiar characteristics no longer exist (12)? - Does spectrum monopoly exist? - Are licensed users privileged with “huge tracts of the public’s airwaves free of charge”?

INTRODUCTIONThe Vermont Public Service Board (\"Board\") and Vermont Public Service Department(\"Department\") hereby submit these reply comments in response to the Federal CommunicationsCommission's (\"Commission\" or \"FCC\") Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NPRM\") and theWireline Competition Bureau's Public Notice in the above-captioned proceedings.1 The Board is a three member, quasi-judicial board that supervises the rates, quality ofservice, and overall financial management of Vermont's public utilities: electric, gas,telecommunications, and private water companies. The Board also supervises certain aspects ofcable television companies in matters not preempted by federal authority.The Department is an agency within the executive branch of Vermont state governmentand is charged with representing the public interest in energy, telecommunications, water, andwastewater utility matters.II.  SUPPORT AND ENDORSE PRIOR COMMENTSThe Board and Department support and endorse the comments submitted to theCommission in the above-captioned proceedings by the following parties:  State of Vermont'sOffice of the Attorney General,2  the Attorneys General of the States of Illinois and New York,3 the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Cable,4 and Netflix, Inc.5  Particularpositions of these parties that the Board and Department support will be detailed throughoutthese reply comments.    1.  Promoting and Protecting the Open Internet, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, GN Docket No. 14-28, FCC 14-61 (rel. May 15, 2014); Wireline Competition Bureau Seeks to Refresh the Record in the 2010 Proceeding on TitleII and Other Potential Legal Frameworks for Broadband Internet Access, Public Notice, GN Docket No. 10-127, DA14-748 (rel. May 30, 2014).    2.  Comments of the Attorney General of Vermont, filed July 18, 2014 (\"VT Comments\").    3.  Comments of the People of the State of Illinois and the People of the State of New York, filed July 15, 2014(\"Joint Comments\").    4.  Comments of the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Cable, filed July 14, 2014 (\"MassComments\").    5.  Comments of Netflix, Inc., filed July 15, 2014 (\"Netflix Comments\").1III.  RECLASSIFY BROADBAND AS A \"TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE\" SUBJECT TO TITLE II REGULATIONThe Board and Department assert, as the Board has done before the Commission at othertimes in the past,6 that broadband Internet service should be reclassified from an \"informationservice\" to \"telecommunications service\" subject to regulation pursuant to Title II of theTelecommunications Act of 1996.7  The VT Comments, Joint Comments, Mass Comments, andNetflix Comments all make this same point to varying degrees.(a)  Broadband service should be subject to the same Title II common carrierrequirements as telephone networks.The Board and Department endorse the comments stating that broadband Internet serviceis a \"telecommunications service\" that should be classified as such and subject to similar Title IIcommon carrier requirements as telephone networks.  This reclassification is appropriate becausebroadband Internet service is essentially a transmission service - a service that enables consumersto access the Internet and send/receive content.  From the consumers' perspective, Internet serviceproviders (\"ISPs\") provide access to the Internet.  When ISPs provide other services in additionto access (i.e., information, storage of information, and information processing - all types of\"information services\"), those other services are neither central nor definitive.  Rather, Internetaccess and the transmission of content are what consumers purchase, services much moreappropriately identified as \"telecommunications service\".The Board and Department recognize that certain parties maintain that the transmissionelement is inextricably linked to the content for broadband.  To the extent this was true at onetime, it is not correct now, as the retail service offerings of providers make clear.  It is possible topurchase broadband service without also purchasing any content, which would not be possible ifthe transmission and content were linked. Therefore, the Board and Department endorse the call    6.  In the Matter of the Preserving the Open Internet Order Remand, Public Notice, GN Docket No. 14-28, DA 14-211 (rel. February 19, 2014), Comments of the Vermont Public Service Board, filed March 24, 2014.    7.  47 U.S.C. §151 et seq.2to reclassify broadband Internet service as a \"telecommunications service\" regulated under TitleII.(b)  Prior two attempts using Section 706 resulted in delays and ambiguity.The Board and Department endorse the comments cautioning the FCC against relyingupon Section 706 as the primary source of authority for regulating broadband Internet service andISPs.  As other parties have noted, the two prior attempts by the Commission to rely uponSection 706 to impose reasonable and fair conditions upon the provision of broadband Internetservice resulted in years of litigation resulting from actions initiated by Comcast and Verizon.8, 9 Notwithstanding the recent decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, relying uponSection 706 again is too risky and too likely to prolong the ambiguity currently besetting thefield.  By relying on Section 706, the Commission risks the ISPs once again embroiling theCommission and other parties in years of costly, time-consuming litigation that benefits no oneexcept, perhaps, the ISPs and the large law firms representing them.  Moreover, if subsequentlySection 706 is found not to provide a jurisdictional basis for open Internet rules, those ruleswould be voided, undermining Commission policy and leading to a further period of uncertainty. Such an outcome should be avoided.  Therefore, the Board and Department endorse the call toreclassify broadband Internet service as a \"telecommunications service\" regulated under Title II,rather than relying on Section 706 authority.(c) The Verizon Court specifically noted Title II as an option.The Board and Department endorse the comments noting that the District of ColumbiaCircuit Court of Appeals in the Verizon decision itself pointed to Title II as a viable meansthrough which the Commission could act to regulate ISPs and maintain the kind of open Internet    8.  Verizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d 623 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Comcast Corp. v. FCC, 600 F.3d 642 (D.C. Cir. 2010).    9.  Interestingly, both Comcast and Verizon in their own comments in this docket caution the Commission thatreclassifying broadband Internet service as a \"telecommunications service\" subject to regulation under Title II willlead to years of litigation.  It seems that no matter what path the FCC takes, Comcast and Verizon will ensure thereare years of litigation so as to delay or avoid the fair, reasonable conditions the FCC seeks to impose on ISP activity(i.e., no blocking and unreasonable discrimination).3that benefits consumers and our economy as a whole.10  The DC Circuit Court clearly indicatedthat the Commission is not forever bound by its current classification of ISPs as \"informationservices\" and could, instead, reclassify broadband Internet service as a \"telecommunicationsservice\" subject to Title II regulation.11  Such a reclassification, as has been noted by severalother commenters, places the FCC's legal footing on much firmer ground.  For this reason, theBoard and Department encourage the Commission to reclassify broadband Internet service as a\"telecommunications service\" subject to Title II regulation.IV. UPHOLD NET NEUTRALITY AS IT HAS BEEN UNDERSTOODTRADITIONALLYThe Board and Department endorse the VT Comments, Joint Comments, MassComments, and Netflix Comments insofar as they support the idea that net neutrality hastraditionally been understood to mean that broadband Internet service providers should not block,limit, or otherwise degrade broadband access for users of the Internet.  The practices of allowingpaid-for-priority access (with faster and slower lanes), limiting openness, and offering minimumservice levels - all of which are contemplated by the proposed rules and all of which run counterto a traditional understanding of net neutrality - should be forbidden by the rules eventuallyadopted by the Commission.(a) Net Neutrality should be understood as defined in NARUC resolutions.The National Association of Regulated Utility Commissioners (\"NARUC\") has issuedseveral resolutions over the years on net neutrality, the most recent of which was issued on July16, 2014.12  The Board and Department understand net neutrality to have the meaning expressed    10.  Verizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d at 650.    11.  Verizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d at 630-31 and 636.    12.  NARUC Resolution to Ensure Jurisdictional Bases for Open Internet Rules, at http://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/Resolution%20to%20Ensure%20Jurisdictional%20Bases%20for%20Open%20Internet%20Rules.pdf .  Also see NARUC November 13, 2002 Resolution Regarding Citizen Access to InternetContent athttp://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/Resolution%20on%20Fair%20and%20Non%20Discriminatory%20Access%20to%20Content.pdf and NARUC February 17, 2010 Resolution on Open Access to the Internet at4in those various resolutions.  Net neutrality involves the right of consumers to access the Internetwithout restrictions as to viewpoint and in a manner that does not involve unreasonablediscrimination as to the lawful  choice of content (including software applications).  Furthermore,net neutrality means transparency; that is, consumers must receive meaningful informationregarding the technical limitations of their broadband service.  The FCC should regulate in afashion that upholds and advances net neutrality so understood.(b) Pay for Priority runs counter to traditional Net Neutrality.The Board and Department endorse the comments opposing the FCC's proposed rules thatwould allow for a pay-for-priority model in which ISPs could charge edge providers (i.e.,providers of services that make use of the Internet access) higher fees in exchange for havingfaster, priority channels over which to distribute their content.  Pay-for-priority runs totallycounter to traditional notions of net neutrality and is simply bad public policy.  The Board andDepartment join other commenters in strongly encouraging the Commission to eliminate from itsproposed rules anything that would encourage or permit pay-for-priority arrangements by ISPs.The FCC's proposed rules allow for pay for priority for the first time.  This policy wouldessentially allow the ISP to determine what content will most quickly reach the consumer and,thus, which content is most likely to be viewed by the consumer.  Ultimately, the ISPs will beable to skew the playing field in favor of their own preferred services, products, information, andpartners.  This is totally opposite to the idea of a neutral Internet where the consumers choosewhat wins and loses, not ISPs who can rig the game so certain players have unfair advantages.As Netflix comments, the Internet as it operates today is a competitive equalizer becauseall content providers have the same opportunity to reach consumers.  In this situation, consumers,not ISPs, pick the economic winners and losers.13  With pay-for-priority, established contentproviders with more resources will be able to pay ISPs for a fast lane that allows them to reachconsumers more quickly and uniformly; new content providers with limited resources, but not    12.  (...continued)http://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/Resolution%20on%20Net%20Neutrality.pdf.    13.  Netflix Comments at 5.5necessarily lesser quality content, will be forced to compete on an unequal playing field. Pay-for-priority will result in one of two equally bad outcomes: (a) consumers will have fewerchoices and diversity in edge providers with poorer service from those who remain, or (b)  ISPswill use paid prioritization as a method to quell competition by favoring their own affiliates andtheir own services with faster lanes, inundating consumers with content from the ISP (or itsaffiliates) rather than allowing the consumer to choose which services he or she prefers.  Neitherof those options is comparable to the open Internet where consumer preference drives Internettraffic.  Furthermore, with paid prioritization consumers will be charged at both ends of thetransaction.  Edge providers now needing to pay for priority to reach customers will inevitablypass those new costs on to consumers by increasing the price of their goods and services. Meanwhile, consumers are still going to have to pay their ISP access charges for Internet service,as ISPs are highly unlikely to reduce charges to consumers even given the new revenue streamfrom edge providers for prioritization.  With paid prioritization, consumers will be left paying thebill on both ends.(c) The openness fostered by traditional Net Neutrality is of profound value.The Board and Department endorse the comments that encourage the Commission toembrace rules that foster true openness and neutrality on the Internet because that openness is atthe heart of the real economic, civic, and cultural value generated by the Internet over the pasttwo decades.\"The internet's ability to generate innovation, investment, and economic growth is aproduct of its openness.\"14  As several parties have noted, openness has generated a virtuouscycle in which the deeper and richer content available on the Internet from edge providers drivesconsumers to demand and ISPs to build better and faster broadband connectivity, which in turnleads to more enhanced, innovative content.  Unless the Commission has the capability and    14.  Netflix Comments at 3, quoting the Amicus of Internet Engineers and Technologists, filed in Verizon v. FCC,No. 11-1355 at 3 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 15, 2012).6established standards to safeguard this cycle, its ability to produce its many benefits will beundermined, perhaps destroyed entirely.In opposing Title II regulation, some parties have opined that the open Internet of today -and all of its benefits - is not the child of regulation; rather, they say, it came to pass with little ifany regulation.  It is important to remember that lack of regulation was not the key; it was theopenness of the Internet itself and the various Internet access platforms that was critical.  ISPsoperated an open, neutral platform on which all comers could compete equally.  Absent anti-competitive behavior by ISPs, there was little need for regulation.  It is the new, unprecedentednetwork management arrangements that ISPs are proposing, and in some cases already engagingin, that give rise to the need for regulation to maintain the openness and neutrality that make theInternet such a powerful engine of growth and opportunity.15  ISPs are disingenuous to complainabout proposed regulation when it is precisely their altered behavior that gives rise to the need forthat regulation.V. TWO TIER INTERNET IS HARMFUL TO THE PUBLIC GOODThe Board and Department endorse the VT Comments, Joint Comments, MassComments, and Netflix Comments insofar as those comments indicate that pay-for-priority willcreate a two-tier Internet in which competition will be harmed and the public good damaged.The Commission's proposed rules prevent blocking a website entirely, but they allowISPs to degrade service to content providers who do not pay for priority, essentially enablingISPs to downgrade content providers to a \"minimum level of access\".  Minimum service levelswill undermine competition and harm the public good.  When all edge providers play on an evenfield, the only thing that matters is quality of content.  Consumers' choices are driven by thatcontent and nothing else - content providers who meet the demands of consumers win and thosewho do not lose.  However, under a pay-for-priority scenario, content is no longer king.  Even thebest content, if it travels at the minimum level of access on the bottom tier of a two-tiered, pay-    15.  Recall that it was Comcast's \"throttling\" of BitTorrent traffic in 2007-2008 that was an impetus for theissuance of the Open Internet Order.7for-priority system, could be swamped by lesser-quality content that is easier and quicker for aconsumer to access.Consider that part of what makes the Internet special is its ability to enable contentproviders with great ideas and innovative content to quickly, cheaply, and efficiently reach aglobal audience.  It is the idea, the content that matters and makes the difference.  In such asituation, new entrants can compete as long as their ideas and content capture the consumers'attention.  Under a pay-for-priority scheme, new entrants no longer can rely on their ideas alone. With a two-tiered Internet, as contemplated under the Commission's proposed rules, a newentrant with insufficient capital with which to pay for priority access will immediately be at adisadvantage compared to an edge provider that can afford to pay-for-priority.  Importantly, s/hewill be at a disadvantage not because of the merit of his or her content but because the Internetwould no longer be the level playing field it has always been.Vermont is a small, rural state filled with many small businesses.  Vermonters havebenefitted greatly from the level playing field the Internet provides and, through the Internet,have access to much greater exposure than our rural setting traditionally allowed.  Many of thesebusinesses possess limited capital resources with which to purchase a spot on the fast-lane. Vermont businesses should be able to provide their products and services freely on the Internet,allowing the market to decide whether or not their services and products are valued.  They shouldnot be at the mercy of pay-for-priority arrangements with ISPs.Finally, paid prioritization is fundamentally at odds with the public interest becauseconsumers and content providers are uniquely vulnerable to ISPs.  ISPs have clear, unequivocaleconomic incentives to interfere with competitive services by dealing preferentially with theirown affiliates and business partners and to charge fees to content providers.  ISPs also havedisproportional bargaining power.  Most edge providers do not have the resources to deal withlarge, entrenched ISPs, and most consumers do not have the technological know-how.  It is asituation almost perfectly designed for consumers and edge providers to be taken advantage of,which is bad public policy and bad for competition. VI. PROPOSED RULES ARE NOT EASILY ENFORCEABLE8The Board and Department endorse the VT Comments, Joint Comments, MassComments, and Netflix Comments insofar as those comments indicate that the Commission'sproposed rules are not drafted in a manner that will allow for easy or effective enforcement.(a) Proposed rules are too vague.The Board and Department endorse the comments stating that some key terms used in theproposed rules are too vague and will lead to unnecessary confusion and litigation.  For example,the \"commercially reasonable\" standard as it stands is problematically vague.  The proposed rulesnow require that, if an ISP engages in blocking and discriminatory practices, those practices mustbe \"commercially reasonable\".16  Unfortunately, that standard goes undefined in the rules. Furthermore, it is not clear how a \"commercially reasonable\" standard could be used in allsituations with all content providers.  (For example, can one really refer to the \"commerciallyreasonable\" standard in relation to edge provider content relating to free speech and civicengagement?)17  This kind of ambiguity is going to result in the need for the FCC to be involvedin case-by-case interpretations of the standard, which is something the FCC has recognized.18(b) Case by Case reviews will be too burdensome.The Board and Department endorse the comments stating that the Commission's proposalto conduct case-by-case reviews for commercial reasonableness are going to be too burdensome. This type of review suffers from three weaknesses.  First, a case-by-case review simply invitestoo much intervention by the Commission into the daily business of the participants.  Second, itwill take too long for a cognizable interpretation of the standard to arise out of such a case-by-case review.  In the meantime, consumers, content providers, and ISPs will be left in a state oflegal and business limbo, unsure of how to proceed safely until such an interpretation emerges. Finally, a case-by-case review plays into the hands of the entrenched ISPs.  ISPs have the    16.

Edge providers do not have either the resources or the experience.  Such animbalanced field will only yield results more favorable to the ISPs and less rooted in fairness forconsumers and edge providers.  (c) Transparency rules will be ineffective.The Board and Department endorse the comments stating that the proposed transparencyrules, although well-intentioned, largely will be ineffective in protecting consumers.  Generallyspeaking, the average consumer does not have the technical expertise to understand the fine printassociated with pay-for-priority agreements.  Even assuming consumers have that knowledge,consumers do not have the kind of coordinated market power required to compel ISPs to stopusing pay-for-priority arrangements.  Further, consumers usually have only one or two ISPchoices.  As the industry adopts pay-for-priority, it is likely that all ISPs will adopt their use, soswitching ISPs, where possible, probably will not prove effective to alter ISP behavior. VII. STAKEHOLDER GROUPThe Board and Department strongly oppose the adoption by the Commission of rules thatwill allow pay-for-priority arrangements.  However, should the Commission adopt thesearrangements, then, as noted in the Mass Comments, the Commission should create a NetNeutrality Council  to help establish clear, enforceable standards.  The Council should becomprised of members from a wide range of stakeholders, including from state commissions.VIII. CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the Board and Department respectfully urge the FCC toreclassify broadband Internet service as a \"telecommunications service\" subject to the commoncarrier requirements of Title II.  In doing so, the Commission will ensure net neutrality, protectconsumers and edge providers, and provide room for innovation, competition, and growth in theindustry.10Respectfully submitted      /s/ John D.

	 "text" : "7522616686.txt Of the million or so comments the Federal Communications Commission received on its rulemaking, did any make an evidence-based case that the Internet is not free, open,and functioning well?  Evidence matters.  And there simply is no evidence to back upthe dire claims of disaster if the Internet is left unregulated.  The unregulated Internet is probably the greatest success story of the century.  The body of evidence is very clear ? investment and innovation aimed at winning customers is themost powerful force for good when it comes to developing the Internet.  Tens of billions of private dollars pour into its networks every year, even in a bad economy.  The only reason to change this is to appease a small left-wing political faction that is ideologically obsessed with government control over the economy.  Ifthe FCC has descended to the depths where it ignores evidence so it can appease an ignorant, angry left-wing political faction, then it is time to consider whether theagency should continue to exist in its present form.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522616699.txt The ideological leader of the angry liberals calling for you to reduce the Internet to a public utility is Robert McChesney, the avowed Marxist founder of the socialistgroup Free Press.  In an interview with SocialistProject.ca, McChesney said: ?What we want to have in the U.S. and in every society is an Internet that is not private property, but a public utility...At the moment, the battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies. We are not at thatpoint yet. But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phoneand cable companies and to divest them from control.? In a country of over 300 million people, even an extremist like McChesney can find, perhaps, millions of followers.  But you should know better than to listen to them.Page 1",

Rather thanheed these warnings, the Commission is doubling down, threatening to place the most onerous regulations imaginable on the Internet, subjecting it to 1930s-style regulations meant for telephone monopolies.  The Internet is not a monopoly or a public utility.  The Internet is a massive network of networks that has arisen, not by government fiat, but through free, spontaneous arrangements by investors, engineers, businesses and the consumers they serve.  The FCC should heed the sober warnings of the two branches of government that have instructed it to cease and desist in this reckless, destructive effort to regulate the Internet.Page 1",

The FCC itself argued before the US Supreme Court that Internet services are unregulated information services, not a regulated telephone service.  And what events, or what new evidence does the FCC have to justify this about-face?  None whatsoever.  The FCC?s sudden change of mind in the absence of any real evidence or any clear problem is an arbitrary power grab,plain and simple to any reasonable person.  By taking such reckless actions to gain control over the Internet, the FCC is ironically presenting a powerful argument thatit has become largely irrelevant in the present world of competitive data services. As Congress reconsiders telecommunications in the coming years, it will no doubt consider what to do with the very expensive, largely irrelevant, and power-hungry agency that the FCC has sadly become.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522616704.txt Americans have been getting faster and faster Internet speeds because of competitionin the free economy, not because of anything the government has done.  The Internet does not need the federal government?s ?help,? and neither the American people nor their elected representatives are asking for the federal government to place political controls over the Internet.  The people calling for government control over the Internet are a tiny minority of far-left political activists, and the FCC knows it.  Any effort by the FCC to regulate the Internet will be seen by the vast majority of the American people for what it is -- another lawless Obama Administration power grab.Page 1",

Many of these organizations are openly socialist and see destroying a major sector of the U.S. economy as a good thing in itself.  Others are simply being swept up in sloganeering from comedians.  And the same scare stories have been told for ten years ? that unless you regulate, big bad phone and cable companies will destroy the Internet.  Never happened and never will,because of competition.  But a powerful government regulator really could create mischief, and there would be no place else to turn.  Don?t ruin a good thing.Page 1",

The Internet is not a monopoly or a public utility.  The Internet is a massive network of networks that has arisen, not by government fiat, but through free, spontaneous arrangements by investors, engineers, businesses and the consumers they serve.  The FCC should heed the sober warnings of the two branches of government that have instructed it to cease and desist in this reckless, destructive effort to regulate the Internet.Page 1",

The FCC itself argued before the US Supreme Court that Internet services are unregulated information services, not a regulated telephone service.  And what events, or what new evidence does the FCC have to justify this about-face?  None whatsoever.  The FCC?s sudden change of mind in the absence of any real evidence or any clear problem is an arbitrary power grab,plain and simple to any reasonable person.  By taking such reckless actions to gain control over the Internet, the FCC is ironically presenting a powerful argument thatit has become largely irrelevant in the present world of competitive data services. As Congress reconsiders telecommunications in the coming years, it will no doubt consider what to do with the very expensive, largely irrelevant, and power-hungry agency that the FCC has sadly become.Page 1",

When a government agency like the FCC follows such extremists, acting without evidence, and increasing its own power under imaginary orfalse pretenses, then the people?s representatives in Congress must cut off its funding and place its necessary duties in the hands of agencies that will act responsibly.

	 "text" : "7522616700.txt Of the million or so comments the Federal Communications Commission received on its rulemaking, did any make an evidence-based case that the Internet is not free, open,and functioning well?  Evidence matters.  And there simply is no evidence to back upthe dire claims of disaster if the Internet is left unregulated.  The unregulated Internet is probably the greatest success story of the century.  The body of evidence is very clear ? investment and innovation aimed at winning customers is themost powerful force for good when it comes to developing the Internet.  Tens of billions of private dollars pour into its networks every year, even in a bad economy.  The only reason to change this is to appease a small left-wing political faction that is ideologically obsessed with government control over the economy.  Ifthe FCC has descended to the depths where it ignores evidence so it can appease an ignorant, angry left-wing political faction, then it is time to consider whether theagency should continue to exist in its present form.Page 1",

By trying for a third time to regulate the Internet, the FCC is demonstrating that it is no longer acting in the interests of the American people.

But instead of doing these things that would improve the Internet, the FCC is wasting its time in an obsessive drive to regulate.

The FCC itself argued before the US Supreme Court that Internet services are unregulated information services, not a regulated telephone service.  And what events, or what new evidence does the FCC have to justify this about-face?  None whatsoever.  The FCC?s sudden change of mind in the absence of any real evidence or any clear problem is an arbitrary power grab,plain and simple to any reasonable person.  By taking such reckless actions to gain control over the Internet, the FCC is ironically presenting a powerful argument thatit has become largely irrelevant in the present world of competitive data services. As Congress reconsiders telecommunications in the coming years, it will no doubt consider what to do with the very expensive, largely irrelevant, and power-hungry agency that the FCC has sadly become.Page 1",

	 "text" : "7522616730.txt Of the million or so comments the Federal Communications Commission received on its rulemaking, did any make an evidence-based case that the Internet is not free, open,and functioning well?  Evidence matters.  And there simply is no evidence to back upthe dire claims of disaster if the Internet is left unregulated.  The unregulated Internet is probably the greatest success story of the century.  The body of evidence is very clear ? investment and innovation aimed at winning customers is themost powerful force for good when it comes to developing the Internet.  Tens of billions of private dollars pour into its networks every year, even in a bad economy.  The only reason to change this is to appease a small left-wing political faction that is ideologically obsessed with government control over the economy.  Ifthe FCC has descended to the depths where it ignores evidence so it can appease an ignorant, angry left-wing political faction, then it is time to consider whether theagency should continue to exist in its present form.Page 1",

	 "text" : "60000841310.txt Dear Chairman Wheeler:We are writing to urge you to implement strong and unambiguous net neutrality rules that protect the Internet from discrimination and other practices that will impede its ability to serve our democracy, empower consumers, and fuel economic growth. Erecting toll booths or designating fast lanes on the information superhighway wouldstifle free speech, limit consumer choice, and thwart innovation.  The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers, creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the future.The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy. The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

	 "text" : "60000841328.txt Dear Chairman Wheeler:We are writing to urge you to implement strong and unambiguous net neutrality rules that protect the Internet from discrimination and other practices that will impede its ability to serve our democracy, empower consumers, and fuel economic growth. Erecting toll booths or designating fast lanes on the information superhighway wouldstifle free speech, limit consumer choice, and thwart innovation.  The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers, creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the future.The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy. The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws.

	 "text" : "60000841337.txt Dear Chairman Wheeler:We are writing to urge you to implement strong and unambiguous net neutrality rules that protect the Internet from discrimination and other practices that will impede its ability to serve our democracy, empower consumers, and fuel economic growth. Erecting toll booths or designating fast lanes on the information superhighway wouldstifle free speech, limit consumer choice, and thwart innovation.  The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers, creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the future.The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy. The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

	 "text" : "60000841346.txt Dear Chairman Wheeler:We are writing to urge you to implement strong and unambiguous net neutrality rules that protect the Internet from discrimination and other practices that will impede its ability to serve our democracy, empower consumers, and fuel economic growth. Erecting toll booths or designating fast lanes on the information superhighway wouldstifle free speech, limit consumer choice, and thwart innovation.  The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers, creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the future.The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy. The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",

Erecting toll booths or designating fast lanes on the information superhighway wouldstifle free speech, limit consumer choice, and thwart innovation.  The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers, creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the future.The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy. The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square.

	 "text" : "60000841383.txt Dear Chairman Wheeler:We are writing to urge you to implement strong and unambiguous net neutrality rules that protect the Internet from discrimination and other practices that will impede its ability to serve our democracy, empower consumers, and fuel economic growth. Erecting toll booths or designating fast lanes on the information superhighway wouldstifle free speech, limit consumer choice, and thwart innovation.  The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers, creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the future.The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy. The FCC should protect accessto the Internet under a Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance, thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for users and broadband providers.To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rulebanning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness should not only applyto the so-called last-mile network, but also at points of interconnection to the broadband access provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed or mobile connections. The FCC's proposed rules would be a significant departure from how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs, and employees have invested in businesses based on the certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications laws. When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and citizens. We urge you to take boldand unequivocal action that will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords for innovation, economic development, communication, and democracy itself.Page 1",
